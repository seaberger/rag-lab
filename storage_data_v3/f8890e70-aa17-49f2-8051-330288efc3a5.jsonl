These sensors can sustain power densities up to 14 kW/cm² at 1 kW and up to 2.3 kW/cm² at 6 kW. There are several models available with maximum power limits of 1 kW, 3 kW, and 6 kW in USB, RS-232, and DB25 cable configurations (DB25 cables are used with Coherent’s stand-alone power meters).\n\n**Features & Benefits**\n- Power handling up to 6 kW (model dependent)\n- BB+ Coating with high power density threshold\n- Broadband coating from 190 nm to 11 microns\n- Large 50 mm diameter active area\n- USB, RS-232, and DB25 configurations\n\n**Applications**\n- Laser power monitoring of CW or modulated lasers\n- Manufacturing, QA, and Engineering Applications\n- Commercial OEM integration\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n\n| Specifications          | PM1K+          | PM3K+          | PM6K+          |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Wavelength Range (µm)   | 0.19 to 11     | 0.19 to 11     | 0.19 to 11     |\n| Power Range¹ ² (W)      | 5 to 1000      | 5 to 3000      | 10 to 6000     |\n| Max.

Minimum power reflects typical water flow variation with chiller in a lab environment.\n\n² Max power is beam size dependent - see Power Level by Beam Size Plots.\n\n³ NEP is pure electrical noise without water.\n\n⁴ Water temperature should be stable to <1°C change per minute and <2% variation in flow rate per minute for greatest accuracy. Expect ~5 PSI pressure drop at 2.5 GPM and 10 PSI at 3 GPM.\n\n---\n\n### Typical Performance Data\n\n**BB+ Absorber Coating Optical Absorptivity**\n\n- Graph showing absorptivity (%) vs. wavelength (µm).\n\n**PM1K+ Beam Size vs Power Plot**\n\n- Graph showing beam diameter (mm) vs. laser power (kW).\n\n**PM3K+ Beam Size vs Power Plot**\n\n- Graph showing beam diameter (mm) vs. laser power (kW).\n\n**PM6K+ Beam Size vs Power Plot**\n\n- Graph showing beam diameter (mm) vs. laser power (kW).\n\n---\n\n### Mechanical Specifications\n\n**PowerMax BB+ DB25 kW Sensor**\n\n- Front and side view diagrams with dimensions.\n\n**PowerMax BB+ USB/RS-232 kW Sensor**\n\n- Front and side view diagrams with dimensions.\n\n---\n\nCoherent, Inc.  \n5100 Patrick Henry Drive Santa Clara, CA 95054  \np.
