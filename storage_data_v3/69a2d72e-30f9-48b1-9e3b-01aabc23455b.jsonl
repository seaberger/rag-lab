These sensors work with CW (continuous wave) as well as pulsed sources greater than 100 pps.\n\nThe standard UV/VIS has a removable nose cone that can be used to reduce stray light, and the Wand UV/VIS incorporates a thin profile metal enclosure to fit into tight locations. Fiber optic accessories are available for use with the Wand UV/VIS sensor.\n\nUSB sensors plug directly into a PC and can be operated through our PC software application (included) or directly via host commands.\n\n### Features & Benefits\n\n- Power measurement from 5 μW to >100 mW\n- 100 nW resolution\n- 8 mm and 10 mm apertures\n- Thin 5.5 mm Wand sensor fits into tight spaces between system optics\n- Ideal for measuring low power laser diodes\n- Direct USB interface\n\n### Applications\n\n- Bioinstrumentation\n- Scientific\n- Quality Control\n- Field Service\n- Manufacturing\n\n---\n\n## Specifications\n\n| Specifications                  | PowerMax-USB UV/VIS | PowerMax-USB UV/VIS Wand |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Wavelength Range (nm)           | 325 to 1065         | 325 to 1065              |\n| Power Range¹                    | 5 μW to >100 mW     | 8.5 μW to >140 mW        |\n| Noise Equivalent Power (nW)     | 100                 | 170                      |\n| Maximum Power Density (W/cm²)   | 20                  | 20                       |\n| Response Time (sec.)            |                     |                          |\n| Speed-up On                     | -                   | -                        |\n| Speed-up Off (0% to 100%)       | 0.1                 | 0.5                      |\n| Detector Element                | Silicon photodiode  | Silicon photodiode       |\n| Optic                           | ND2                 | Diffuse Quartz           |\n| Detector Diameter (mm)          | 10                  | 8                        |\n| Calibration Uncertainty (%) (k=2)| ±1                 | ±1                       |\n| Power Linearity (%)             | ±1                  | ±1                       |\n| Spectral Compensation Accuracy (%) |                  |                          |\n| 325 to 900 nm                   | ±4                  | ±4                       |\n| 900 to 1065 nm                  | ±5                  | ±5                       |\n| Calibration Wavelength (nm)     | 514                 | 514                      |\n| Cooling Method                  | Air                 | Air                      |\n| Cable Type                      | USB                 | USB                      |\n| Cable Length (m)                | 2.5                 | 2.5                      |\n| Part Number²                    | 1168337*            | 1299161*                 |\n\n¹ Wavelength dependent, see chart on next page.  \n² Software and post stand included.  \n* C24 Quick Ship program eligible for next business day shipment.\n\n---\n\n## Typical Performance Data\n\nWe incorporate spectral compensation in the PowerMax-USB UV/VIS sensors to provide accurate measurements across the 325 nm to 1065 nm spectrum. Because the spectral response of the filter and photodiode varies significantly across this wavelength range it is important to check the maximum measurable power at the wavelength of use to make sure the sensor is not being saturated.\n\nThis curve plots the maximum measurable power, which is the saturation level of the photodiode, as well as the minimum recommended power level, by wavelength.\n\n### Saturation and Minimum Power UV/VIS Sensors Over Wavelength\n\n![Graph of Saturation and Minimum Power UV/VIS Sensors Over Wavelength](image)\n\n---\n\n## Typical Performance Data (continued)\n\n### Angular Sensitivity\n\nThe following curves plot the sensitivity to incident angle, and numerical aperture in the case of non-collimated beams.\n\n- **Angular Dependence**\n\n![Graph of Angular Dependence](image)\n\n- **Numerical Aperture Dependence**\n\n![Graph of Numerical Aperture Dependence](image)\n\n### Measurement Linearity\n\nLike all silicon photodiodes, the UV/VIS Quantum sensor has temperature sensitivity in the infrared region.\n\nAt 1064 nm, for example, it has a 0.5%/°C thermal coefficient. Measurement error of up to 2% are present at 1064 nm after a 10 minute warm-up time due to the electronics inside the sensor, and additional error can be present if the ambient measurement environment differs from the calibration wavelength listed on the calibration certificate.\n\nIn practice, wavelengths shorter than 1000 nm have insignificant effects due to temperature.\n\nThe following chart references the thermal coefficient at the wavelength of use.\n\n![Graph of Photo Sensitivity Temperature Characteristic](image)\n\n---\n\n## Mechanical Specifications\n\n### PowerMax-USB UV/VIS Power Sensor\n\n- **Front View**\n\n![Front View Diagram](image)\n\n- **Side View**\n\n![Side View Diagram](image)\n\n- **Bottom View**\n\n![Bottom View Diagram](image)\n\n### PowerMax-USB UV/VIS Wand\n\n- **Top View**\n\n![Top View Diagram](image)\n\n- **Side View**\n\n![Side View Diagram](image)\n\n- **Front View**\n\n![Front View Diagram](image)\n\n---\n\n## Power Sensor Accessories\n\n### Fiber-Optic Connector Adapters\n\n| Part Number | Description                |\n|-------------|----------------------------|\n| 1098589     | SMA-Type Connector         |\n| 1211488     | Collimating Adapter        |\n| 1211489     | FC Fiber Adapter           |\n| 1220619     | FC-APC Fiber Adapter       |\n| 1220621     | SMA Fiber Adapter          |\n| 1220622     | 7 mm Aperture              |\n\n---\n\nCoherent, Inc.,  \n5100 Patrick Henry Drive Santa Clara, CA 95054  \np.
