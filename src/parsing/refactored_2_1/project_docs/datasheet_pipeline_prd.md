## üéØ Product Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a production-ready, intelligent document processing pipeline that transforms technical PDFs and Markdown files into a searchable knowledge base with state-of-the-art retrieval capabilities.

### Problem Statement
Technical organizations struggle with:
- **Information Fragmentation**: Critical technical data scattered across hundreds of PDF datasheets
- **Poor Searchability**: Traditional file search fails to find relevant technical specifications
- **Manual Processing**: Time-consuming manual extraction of model numbers and specifications
- **Knowledge Silos**: Engineers waste time re-finding previously accessed information

### Solution Overview
An automated ETL pipeline that ingests, processes, and indexes technical documents using:
- AI-powered document parsing (OpenAI Vision API)
- Intelligent metadata extraction (model/part number pairs)
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching
- Production-grade caching and error handling
