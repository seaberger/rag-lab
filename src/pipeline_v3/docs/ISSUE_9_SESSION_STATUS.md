# Issue #9 Session Status

## Last Updated: January 11, 2025

### Current Status
- **Branch**: `feature/issue-9-cli-consolidation` (created, ready for work)
- **Phase**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation
- **Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 - Core Pipeline Enhancement

### Session Summary
1. Performed comprehensive gap analysis between cli_main.py and cli_v3.py
2. Identified 8 major features missing from production CLI
3. Created detailed implementation plan (see ISSUE_9_CLI_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md)
4. Updated all relevant documentation
5. Created feature branch for safe development

### Key Findings
- Production CLI (cli_main.py) missing critical batch processing capabilities
- Two separate pipeline implementations causing feature gaps
- Users expect features documented in manual that don't exist
- Decision: Enhance EnhancedPipeline rather than maintaining two pipelines

### For Next Session

**Quick Start Commands**:
```bash
cd /Users/seanbergman/Repositories/rag_lab
git checkout feature/issue-9-cli-consolidation
git status
```

**Begin Implementation - Phase 1**:
1. Start with `pipeline/enhanced_core.py`
2. Add document mode support (datasheet/generic/auto)
3. Verify cache integration
4. Test each change incrementally

**Key Files to Modify**:
- `pipeline/enhanced_core.py` - Add missing features
- `cli/management.py` - Update CLI commands
- `core/pipeline.py` - Reference for features to port

**Testing Strategy**:
- Always verify existing functionality still works
- Test with: `uv run python -m src.pipeline_v3.cli_main add data/sample_docs/labmax-touch-ds.pdf`
- Check artifact creation in `storage_data_v3/`

### Important Context
- This is a HIGH PRIORITY issue blocking production use
- Work on feature branch to avoid breaking main
- Comprehensive testing required before merge
- User expects batch processing that currently doesn't work

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Rejected maintaining two pipelines** - User emphasized that whether docs are added individually or in batch, they must ALL go through the same tracking/registry system
2. **Cache preservation is critical** - Must ensure LLM isn't called repeatedly for same document
3. **EnhancedPipeline is the target** - Don't create a separate batch pipeline; enhance the existing one
4. **cli_v3.py uses different pipeline** - It calls `ingest_sources()` from `core/pipeline.py`, NOT EnhancedPipeline
5. **Root cause of Issue #6** - cli_v3.py worked because it used the complete pipeline with artifact creation

### Implementation Gotchas
- **Two pipeline implementations exist**: `EnhancedPipeline` (incomplete) vs `ingest_sources()` (complete)
- **Don't just wrap ingest_sources** - User wants unified tracking, so port features to EnhancedPipeline
- **Document modes matter** - v2.1 has datasheet/generic/auto modes that affect parsing strategy
- **Progress monitoring** - Must maintain detailed stage tracking, not just basic progress

### User Expectations Not in Manual
- Batch processing of entire directories
- Glob pattern support (*.pdf, **/*.pdf)
- Document classification modes
- URL document fetching
- Custom prompt files per document type
- Processing reports with metrics

### Testing Reminders
- Test with both `data/sample_docs/` (7 files) and `data/lmc_docs/datasheets/` (30 files)
- Verify cache hits on re-processing
- Check that registry tracks ALL documents regardless of how added
- Ensure storage_data_v3/ gets JSONL artifacts for every document

### Documentation Updated
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md - Marked Issue #9 as IN PROGRESS
- ✅ Pipeline v3 CLAUDE.md - Added branch info
- ✅ Repository CLAUDE.md - Updated priority
- ✅ Created detailed plan document
- ✅ Created this session status

Ready for implementation in next session!
